_This Application is about a **Mad Libs Form App**_.<br/>
_version: 12/04/2019_<br/>

_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Description

_Mad Lib itself is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts the words to the other_.<br/>
_to fill in the blank spaces in the sentence or the text._.<br/>
_The Mad Lib **"Form"** works using the same principle, the user is asked to fill in the blanks, in a narrative form_,<br/>
_at the end the user after clicking the button is able to see his/her story in text format_.<br/>
_And that’s it! The form doesn’t take very long to create. Further development will be added.<br/>
_Please give it a try and enjoy making your own Mad Libs form!
